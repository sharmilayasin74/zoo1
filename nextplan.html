<h3>Master plan of a zoo should be a comprehensive document gi ving a
detailed road map for 20 years with a provision of review every 10 years
regarding development , improvement and upgradation of the facilities and
infrastructure available at the zoo and building up of the capacity for carrying out
all the operations forming part of the zoo management with greater efficiency .
The development of the master plan of a zoo involves following steps:-</h3>
<h6>(i) Define the mission, vision and the conservation message of the zoo
through a detailed process of consultation.</h6>
<h6>(ii) Thoroughly inventori se and evaluate the existing infrastructure ,
facilities, resources and services available at the zoo and analyse
the same to ide ntify the areas of strength and weaknesses in order
of priority.</h6>
<h6>(iii) Draft a development brief and identify the priority needs and
development project imperatives to address these needs .</h6>
<h6>(iv) Use of the project imperatives for developing an implementable
action pl an along with estimated costs . Try to match the so
developed action plan and the projected costs with the available
resources and if necessary keep on repeating the process till
optimal relationship among all the components of the master plan
i.e. a happ y marriage between the needs , opportunities,
constraints, risks and rewards is achieved . The concept finally
selected along with summary of other studies listed above should
be submitted to the zoo operator and the Central Zoo Authority for
their concurrence and approval.</h6>
<h6><p>(v) Once the concept plan is approved by the concerned authorities a
comprehensive master plan for the zoo should be developed in the
prescribed format annexed at Annexure â€“ I to these guidelines.
Priority areas to be given special attention during preparation of the master plan</h6>
1. Achieve the highest standards of housing and upkeep for zoo animals
with a view to establish self sustaining populations of genetically and
behaviouraly viable animals adopting latest skills of behavioural
enrichment and genetic management.
2. Planned breeding of endangered species through provision of off the
exhibit breeding enclosures of requisite specification in adequate
number to accommodate the viable breeding population of endangered
species.
3. Availability of req uisite expertise for upkeep and healthcare of the
animals of concerned species for its long-term survival.
4. Thematic display of animals in nature emersing exhibits equipped with
feeding and housing facilities congenial to the species specific
behaviour of the animals housed therein.
5. To assess the carrying capacity of the zoo in respect of visitors having
due regard to space availability and the welfare of the animals
particularly the impact through noise pollution and physical disturbance
by visitors and thereby appropriate measures to limit the number of
visitors within the carrying capacity.
6. Planning the visitor circulation in the zoo in such a manner that the
visitors get unobstructed view of wild animals in a pollution free and
natural environment.
7. Development of appropriate signage s and interpretation facilities that
can help the visitors in understanding the ecological linkages of nature
and developing an empathy for wildlife.
8. Efficient waste disposal system and sanitation practices for maintaining
hygienic and clean environment in the zoo.
9. Design and maintain appropriate public facilities and civic amenities
upto the desired standards.
10. Develop elaborate and effective management plans to deal with
unforeseen contingencies and natural disasters and hi gh influx of
visitors on particular days. <p>
